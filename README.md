==============================

This repository contains key information about Superuser Labs, along with documents and other public resources.

## About the company

Superuser Labs was originally the name for the group of people who were involved with the early development of ActivityWatch and Thankful around 2017-2019. 
As work on Thankful ceased and ActivityWatch became a community-led operation, most contributors moved on except brothers Erik and Johan Bjäreholt.

The company was formally founded in 2022 as a Swedish AB ("Aktiebolag"). 
Company formation happened in response to Erik getting ActivityWatch-related consulting offers, and there being a need to structure donations into an entity. 

A foundation was considered since there is very little financial interest, but was postponed indefinitely due to the operational cost and overhead, as well as the one-way nature of such a decision and there likely being a need for a two-tier structure anyway.
